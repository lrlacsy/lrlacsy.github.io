            <h1>Favorite CMSC Subject</h1>
            <p><span>CMSC 150</span> Although the problems you provide solutions for in R are the difficult mathematics kind, I enjoyed how simple the operations are and the syntax it uses makes it easy to translate your solutions from paper to screen.</p>

            <h1>Favorite GE Subject</h1>
            <p><span>Ethics 1</span> I like answering philosophical questions and pondering on people's views on morality and humanity itself. I also haven't got the chance to enroll in other GE subjects since I entered the University so I don't have much of a choice here :) Still tho, shout out to <b>Sir Jet!</b></p>

            <h1>Favorite Programming Language</h1>
            <p><span>R Programming</span> As I've mentioned above, I love the simplicity but effectiveness of the language itself. It is very powerful if you know how to work your way and familiarize yourself with its ins and outs. <b>Overall: 10/10 PL, would use again.</b></p>

        <div class="food grid-item fade">
            <h1>Favorite Food</h1>
            <p><span>Sushi</span> + Japanese Cuisine in general. I just love everything about their palette, from fine dining to street food. They just hit all the right spots. <b>Hands Down to them for making the world a better place with their immaculate taste.</b></p>
